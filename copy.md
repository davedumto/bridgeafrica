About Us
We started as an experiment by an MBA at UC Berkeley Haas who was building in public,
sharing every win, setback, and lesson. The conversations that followed with founders revealed
a clear truth: visionary teams don’t have time to sift endlessly for A-players. They need
exceptional software talent and operational firepower—now.
So we went all in. We connect bold companies with top-tier African engineers and operations
talent who work like owners and scale with ambition.
Why Africa
Africa is rising. The region is dense with skilled builders who are hungry, resilient, and ready to
compete globally. Diversifying your bench here is like a smart portfolio construction for talent:
high caliber, cost-effective, and committed.
Why Us
●

●
●
Operator DNA: We move like an extension of your internal team—fast, transparent,
accountable.
No voodoo hiring: Rigorous pre-vetting for skill, speed, and cultural fit.
Context first: We learn your pace, values, and roadmap, then curate matches that feel
custom-built.
From day one impact: Our very first placement—a VA for a legal practitioner—became
a growth unlock. We’ve been igniting wins ever since.
Not for Everyone
We’re built for forward-thinking companies willing to try better ways, tap new markets, and raise
the bar. If that’s you, we’re your partner. If not, that’s okay.
Our Promise
We are the hardest workers in the room because we have everything to pove. If a match isn’t
perfect, we pivot—no ego, no excuses—until it is. We’ve codified how to deliver A+ players from
Africa, and we stake our reputation on your outcomes.
At our core, we’re builders too. Join us if you’re ready to redefine what’s possible.
